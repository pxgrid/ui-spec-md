Here is a markdown example with the code block for UI Flows.

    ---
    title: doc title
    screen: ./screen1.png?highlight=[[216,193,150,70],[720,140,130,50]]

    ```uiflows
    [What the user sees]
    What they do
    ==> What the user sees 2

    [What the user sees 2]
    What they do A
    ==> What the user sees 3
    What they do B
    ==> What the user sees 4
